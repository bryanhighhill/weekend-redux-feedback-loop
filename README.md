Installation
How do you get your application up and running? 
This is a step by step list for how another developer could get this project up and running. 
The good target audience in terms of knowledge, would be a fellow Primer from another cohort being able to spin up this project. 
Note that you do not need a paragraph here to intro Installation. 
It should be step-by-step.

If your application has secret keys (for example -- Twilio), make sure you tell them how to set that up, both in getting the key and then what to call it in the .env file.

Create a database named your database name,

The queries in the tables.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. 

The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. 
We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries,

Open up your editor of choice and run an npm install
Run npm run server in your terminal
Run npm run client in your terminal
The npm run client command will open up a new browser tab for you!
